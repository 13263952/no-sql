The motivation for this data manipulation example was to showcase different abilities through MongoDB.


The following skills were showcased:


- Successful data import from a .ipynb file
- Creation of a Mongo Client instance
- Successful update of data in the database
- Creation of filters to sort for specific characteristics




Through the development of this opportunity
I was able to successfully identify restaurants that met specific attributes, such as distance, ratings, and performance.
